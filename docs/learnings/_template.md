# <one-line title — what this entry is about>

## What happened

2–3 sentences. The change, the context. Skip if obvious from the title.

## What surprised me

The non-obvious thing — what made you stop and think. If nothing did, this entry probably shouldn't exist (see `README.md`).

## What the gate caught

What the persona / pressure-test / sign-off surfaced that wasn't in the original brief. If the gate caught nothing, say so explicitly — "gate found nothing" is also a learning, especially if you expected it to.

## What to compound

The concrete artefact that gets updated as a result. Name the file and the change. The point of writing this entry is committing to making the gate / docs / personas smarter.

If the honest answer is "nothing to compound here," reconsider whether the entry is earning its keep.
